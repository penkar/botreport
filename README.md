   __-=BotReport=-__
The BotReport is a stab at the Financial Dark to make financial statment analysis a bit more accessible and understanable to the non-financial public. Ideally a user will be able to sign up, sign in and upload a CSV file with their choice company's annual financial statement data, and in turn receive, financial ratios, a brief review of those financial ratios, common size data, and the ability to push out to future years proforma income. There are still a number of holes and pitfalls in the way the data is computed that will require refactoring and further more professional study. 


Limited Tests. The tests do not include functionality for Active-Records. Requires further refactoring.
