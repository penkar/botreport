ABOUT


The BotReport is a stab at the Financial Dark to make financial statment analysis a bit more accessible and understanable to the non-financial public. Ideally a user will be able to sign up, sign in and upload a CSV file with their choice company's annual financial statement data, and in turn receive, financial ratios, a brief review of those financial ratios, common size data, and the ability to push out to future years proforma income. There are still a number of holes and pitfalls in the way the data is computed that will require refactoring and further more professional study.
